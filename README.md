This project contains a dataset of TV shows. The dataset was created by scraping data from the website IMDb. The data was then cleaned and formatted for use in Tableau.

Scraping data from IMDb

The first step in this project was to scrape data from the website IMDb. IMDb is a popular website that provides information about movies, TV shows, and actors. The data that was scraped from IMDb included the following information:

    Title: The name of the TV show.
    Genre: The genre of the TV show.
    Rating: The rating of the TV show.
    Number of episodes: The number of episodes in the TV show.
    Release date: The release date of the TV show.

Cleaning and formatting the data

Once the data was scraped from IMDb, it needed to be cleaned and formatted. This involved removing any duplicate data, fixing any errors, and formatting the data in a way that was easy to use in Tableau.

Using Tableau to visualize the data

The cleaned and formatted data was then used in Tableau to create visualizations. These visualizations allowed the user to explore the data in a variety of ways. For example, the user could see which TV shows were the most popular, which genres were the most popular, and which TV shows had the highest ratings.

Conclusion

This project was a successful example of how data scraping and Tableau can be used to create valuable insights. The dataset of TV shows that was created in this project can be used by a variety of people, including TV show fans, TV show producers, and TV show researchers.
